# My Favorite Video Game

My favorite all-time game would be **Battlefield 3**. I consider it a classic game, where I have raged intensely but also enjoyed. I liked how there were clear objectives with an *emphasis* on teamwork. Coming from Call of Duty to Battlefield, I loved how detailed the game was and that they put a lot of work they put in, with things like:

* Falling Buildings
* Bullet Drop
* Explosions
* Weapon Quality and Builds
* Different Class for Different Soldiers
